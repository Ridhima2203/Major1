# Real time stock market analysis
The stock market plays a very crucial role in the financial aspect of the nation's growth, but the stock market is highly complex and volatile. It is easily influenced by significant political issues, analyst calls, news articles, the company's plans of expansions and growth, and many more. This project uses the stacked LSTM neural network algorithm, to predict future trends of stock prices based on the price history. Thousands of investors invest in the stock market on every business day. Some of these investors either lose money and others gain. However, considering any trading day, loss or gain is inconsistent. The demand to predict stock prices are extremely high hence is the need for stock market analysis. Effective prediction systems indirectly help traders by providing supportive information such as the future market direction. This project is focused on analyzing a stock of any given company based on statistical technical indicators. Some of these indicators are deterministic and the remaining are probabilistic. The objective of this project is to minimize the risk of loss in every trade thereby maximizing the profit.
